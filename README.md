This is a data project for efficient changing between lines in Berlin.
Take a look at the
[generated](https://github.com/OpenMetroMaps/berlin-change/tree/generated)-branch
for a auto-generated Markdown-view on the data in this repository.

Previously, data has been manually collected in a hand-crafted Markdown files.
Although these files are considered deprecated,
[they are still here](manual/README.md).

The data is stored in the [data.xml](data.xml) file.
Its format is
[specified here](https://github.com/OpenMetroMaps/OpenMetroMaps/blob/master/spec-station-format.md).
The current file format is not capable of storing all relevant data.
This is why we're drafting a new file type, see [stations.xml](stations.xml).
